# Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)

The aim of this laboratory is to teach the PyTorch model to denoise images. Here we simulate one image as vector of shape `(2,)`. First, we train the model on the `bicycle.txt` data. Then we generate a bicycle by denoising the noise generated by normal distribution.
